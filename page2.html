<h1>What's mental health?</h1>


<p>Mental health is an emotional psychological problem caused by any life  trauma or harm or ect.</p>   


<h5>Why talk about mental health?</h5>



<p>Because why not  Mental health is a huge issue in metro Detroit but there is a group of people who are suffering it the most is young kids and young teens.who can't talk about it or just won't because they don't feel safe or there scared and traumatized.</p>

Mental health problems affect about 1 in 10 children and young people. They include depression, anxiety and conduct disorder, and are often a direct response to what is happening in their lives.( Says the mental health foundation). 
And I believe it's true there are young people who are truly suffering from mental problems and some may even be calling out for help and aren't getting it</p>

<h5>Lots of things can cause people to haveike.</h5>


 <ul>Abusers</ul> 
<ul>sexafendees</ul>
 <ul>drugs</ul>
 <ul> bullies</ul>
<ul>deaths</ul> 
 <ul>bad homes</ul> 



<h5>its ok to say i'm not ok </h5>


 <p>And so much more can cause mental illness. pay attention to your teens and kids  even things you do that's not as bad and in reality should never ignore the signs  of  also young teens and kids are very manipulative. I believe it's true there are young people keep things in side because their scared of what might happen or to talk about it and can't some kids don't like hearing the words help and accept the fact that there's somethings wrong   
 And Some kids cry out for that help andarnit receiving it and some parents just tell them to shake it off or you're going through a faze and kinda push it to the side and now that kid has to keep deal with this issue and shake it ok instead of the parent help them and now that kid thinks if i say this again nothing is going to help    
 is now thought to I believe that it starts at childhood and young teens because around this time young kids and teen are vulnerable to so many things. Also kids and teens don't have a say so or control in there life just like their mental issue so pay attention</5>

<h5>how can this upcoming school year affect mental health</h5>

<p>This upcoming school year can affect mental health because it can be scary knowing that there's a crisis and a chance of getting sick it can cause anxiety and maybe even more. Not To mention teens and kids worry about getting picked on and bullied. But however there is positive in this like how we have counselors and mentors and am some of our favourite teachers and trusted adults and friends and hope that this school year goes well.</p>

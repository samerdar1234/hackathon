    <h3><b>What Is Mental Health?</b></h3>
    <p>Mental health includes emotional, psychological, and social well-being.
    It affects the way we think, feel, and act. This usually helps identify how 
    someone deals with stress and problems. Most psychological factors are what
    mainly contribute to mental illness, for example, losing someone thatâ€™s very
    important to you, abuse, trauma, etc. </p>

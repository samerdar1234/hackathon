        <h5>Why Talk About Mental Health?</h5>
        <p>Poor mental health is a huge issue impacting the metro Detroit area,
        however, within this population, children and teenagers are the most
        affected. In a community that does not prioritize good mental health, young people 
        feel silenced. Whether because of trauma, fear, or the lack of support from
        the people around them, young people are struggling to voice how poor mental health
        is negatively impacting them. </p>

        <p>Mental health problems affect about 1 in 10 children and young people. 
        The biggest problems affecting these young people include depression anxiety, 
        and conduct disorder, and these problems are often a direct response to what is
        happening in their lives.(Mental Health Foundation). Staying quiet about 
        these problems only enhances the damages these problems cause on a 
        young person’s life. Unfortunately, even if a young person tries to call for help, 
        often they do not receive the necessary care they need to counteract these mental
        health issues.</p>

        <h5>Common Causes of Poor Mental Health</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Abusers</li>
            <li>Sex Offenders</li>
            <li>Drugs</li>
            <li>Bullies</li>
            <li>Death of a Loved One</li>

        <h5>It is Okay to say, “I’m Not Okay”</h5>
        <p>The list above is not a complete list. Anyone can suffer from poor 
        mental health for any number of reasons. Student-aged children are especially
        vulnerable to mental health problems because of their lack of control in their
        lives at that age and because the stigmatism against mental health prevents
        students from feeling comfortable talking about an issue they may have. 
        So pay attention. If your friend or child has any signs that their mental 
        health may be suffering, reach out to them. Many times, young people are afraid
        of asking for help or even accepting that they have a problem. By reaching out,
        you can make a positive impact on your loved one’s life.</p>

        <h5>How Can this Upcoming School Year Affect Mental Health</h5>
        <p> This upcoming school year can affect mental health even more than 
        the previous years. The fear of getting horribly sick now accompanies 
        the other stresses school provides such as academic pressures, social pressures,
        and the mental pressures. For students, do not be afraid to reach out.
        School may be accompanied by pressure, but it also provides a network 
        to help deal with those pressures. Your counselors, teachers, trusted adults,
        and friends will all be there to help you through your fears and anxieties. 
        You are not alone. Everyone has worries, but by reaching out and communicating
        with your support network, your negative emotions can be alleviated. 
        Poor mental health does not define who you are or who you can be.</p>
